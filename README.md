## Snake Plissken

It's a small snake game build using pygame which plays by itself using Dueling DQN implemented with Pytorch.

If you try to run the game from zero it took me about 1 million iterations to get to this place (see image bellow).

My hardware to train the Agent is:
 - Core i7 (8 cores)
 - 16 Mb
 - NVIDIA Geforce 1060 with 6 Gb
